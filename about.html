    <!-- INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH: Background and motivation for the project -->
    <p>
      This project was created by Riley Dunevent, a student of IT3203 at KSU.  
      I have always been fascinated by the history of video games and how 
      the industry has evolved over time. Through this project, I explored how 
      the fall of Atari in the early 1980s and the video game crash of 1983 
      paved the way for Nintendo's remarkable rise, reshaping 
      gaming culture and technology.  
    </p>

    <!-- PARAGRAPH: Purpose of the project and learning outcomes -->
    <p>
      My goal in creating this website was to share this story in an engaging way.  
      This project has helped me improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and web design, 
      while deepening my appreciation for the history behind modern gaming.
    </p>

    <!-- PARAGRAPH: Personal interests and call to connect -->
    <p>
      Outside of this project, I enjoy exploring technology, programming, building, and designing.
