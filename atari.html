        <!-- Paragraph describing Atari’s early dominance -->
        <p>
          Founded in 1972, Atari brought arcade hits like <em>Pong</em> into homes with the Atari 2600. 
          By the early 1980s, Atari was synonymous with video games, capturing the imagination of millions worldwide.

        <h2>The Beginning of the End</h2>

          <!-- Paragraph explaining rushed production and quality issues -->
          <p>
            By 1982, Atari’s leadership began prioritizing quantity over quality. Poorly made titles and rushed releases 
            overwhelmed consumers. The most infamous of these was <em>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</em>, which was developed 
            in only five weeks and became one of the worst-selling games ever.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 3: Business and leadership issues -->
        <h2>Corporate Missteps</h2>
        <p>
          Atari also suffered from corporate instability and competition. 
          Its parent company, Warner Communications, clashed internally over creative direction and market control. 
          When profits plummeted, layoffs and restructuring followed, signaling the company’s downfall.
        </p>

        <!-- SECTION 4: Long-term impact -->
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Atari’s collapse taught the industry that innovation and quality matter more than speed. 
          Its mistakes became lessons for Nintendo and future developers.
